    "# **Answer2-FFT vs Convolution**\n",
    "FFT key concept is moving from the time domain to the frequency domain. Of note,convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain. when comparing computetional complexity-unlike direct convolution with a complexity of $O(N^2)$, FFT-based convolution operates at $O(N \\log N)$. the complexity of computation affect the time it takes to make all the calculations. In neuroscience,electrphysiological recordings ususally consist >1000 of time points (depends on sampling rate of the signal) and/or multichannel recordings. Running time or speed of calculations is critical for real-time applications usually that are usually handy in electropysiological recordings. By working in the frequency domain, it allows efficient filtering of neural signals to isolate specific frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) and avoids the large memory overhead of direct convolution. It also enables parallel processing of multiple signal channels, scales well for large datasets, and supports the design of custom filters for noise reduction, smoothing, and event detection.\n"

    "A moving average filter reduce high fluctuations and enhance overall trends in a signal (smoothing the signal). It does this by averaging groups of three consecutive points(in our example), which helps to minimize the impact of random fluctuations or noise. with that said, this process introduces a slight delay (latency) in the signal since the filter requires future points to compute the average. For a window size of 3, the delay is approximately 1 sample, meaning the filtered output is slightly behind the original signal. This delay is an important consideration in when executing real-time analysis."
